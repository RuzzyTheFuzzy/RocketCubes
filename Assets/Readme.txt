Mouse to look around
Hold left click to charge grenade
Release to throw
Right click to swap grenades
Q to end/start turn
Esc to pause the game
X to RandomKill (Debug command)

The normal grenades have a big radius and power, so you might want to swap to the low power grenades for close quarters combat

You only lose health from falling into the ocean, so you can use the knockback from grenades to move around

Moving using WASD uses fuel, and when you run out you can no longer move untill your next turn.

Eatch turn you get a refill of grenades and fuel. You can end your turn early with Q.
The screen will show whose turn is next and wait for them to press Q to start their turn.

The options menu lets you change a variety of things that affect gameplay
